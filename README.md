# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-by-Ensemle-Techniques
Given the details of cell nuclei taken from breast mass, objective is to predict whether or not a patient has breast cancer using the Ensembling Techniques. This is a classification problem. The dataset consists of several predictor variables and one target variable, Diagnosis.  The target variable has values 'Benign' and 'Malignant', where 'Benign' means that the  cells are not harmful or there is no cancer and 'Malignant' means that the patient has  cancer and the cells have a harmful effect.

After performing EDA, different models are run and comparison has been made.
